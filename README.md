# Machile Learning Models

This directory contains machine learning models along with some sample
datasets to test them out and a few graphical results of using them in
the sample datasets.

Each model has a Python implementation and a R implementation.

Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.

Models implementated during the course Machine Learning A-Z, by Kirill
Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves.
